# Welcome to the Cantara Project Github page

The Cantara Project is an open source project created by [Jan Martin Reckel](github.com/reckel-jm) to equip the church with tools and songs to worship God. The main core of the project is [Cantara](https://cantara.app) itself (the [Github project](github.com/reckel-jm/cantara) is still on the user account), a song presentation software for churches. This program is now under development for about ten years and used in churches all over the world to display worship songs and hymns.

However, the goal is to expand this development, so that Cantara can also manage, display and export song scores. For this, the song format `.cssf` is under development as well as a [CSSF parser](https://github.com/CantaraProject/CantaraSongScoreFileLib).

As a further step, an online platform with open source hymns and songs of praise shall be developed and published here so that churches and individuals are able to download and use a variety of songs for the praise of God for free. It is also supposed to be a platform for composers to publish new songs of praise.
